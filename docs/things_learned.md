Overview
-

When spending this much time coding, you learn some things. This section is just for us to
write it down, so we can share with each other and look back at what we learned at the end
of everything. It could be java related, IntelliJ related, or design related, or anything
really. Welcome to our space to yap.

> ### Java Docs!
> Don't hyphenate after java docs, it automatically does that for you when you render it.
> right-click the icon on the left of the java doc around where the line numbers are and
> say
> render all doc comments. It looks so cool.
>
> So basically, when a file is somewhat complete and
> stable our standards, that rendered view and read only will help us look at it from a
> different angle, not as developers, but as readers and clients trying to see why a bug
> is
> happening.

> ### Bookmarks!
> **Some Motivation** <br>
> Project Structure became extremely messy as we got more and more files. A lot of extra
> time
> was spent just trying to figure out where to go. And the recently opened files was also
> getting messy. Consider a case where we need to look at three files and print debug in 5
> places and also look at the test that we are writing. So, we need to keep track of a
> couple
> things. We can find the print debugs by doing Ctrl-F, and we can find the files through
> project structure. However, it's cumbersome. I wish we could bookmark exact lines in
> code,
> name them descriptively, and then go back to them. <br>
> **Enter bookmarks** <br>
> Just press f3 or right click and add bookmark on a line of code. You can add a
> description
> right-clicking the icon. It takes you to the exact line!
